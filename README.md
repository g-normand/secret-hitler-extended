This project extends the
  [Secret Hitler](https://www.secrethitler.com/)
print & play by

 - envelopes for all the cards and
 - the rules as an A5 booklet with
 - QR-coded links to helpful resources.

## Assembly

 0. Download and extract the archive with the 
      [latest release](https://github.com/reitzig/secret-hitler-extended/releases/latest).

 1. Print `rules_booklet.pdf` on regular A4 paper (80-100g) (double-sided);
    fold and staple stack along the center to create a booklet.

 2. Print `envelopes.pdf` on slightly thicker (100-120g) A4 paper (one-sided);
    cut along the solid lines.
    
    See
      [here](https://youtu.be/IHMBBFw-pK4?t=40)
    for how to use the envelope template you find on the last page of the PDF.
    You may want to transfer it to cardboard for a better experience.

 3. Print `material.pdf` on thick paper (160g) (one-sided);
    assemble according to the instructions.
    
 4. Put
 
     - a _Secret Role_ card,
     - a corresponding _Party Membership_ card, 
     - one _Ja! Ballot_ card, and 
     - one _Nein! Ballot_ card
        
    in each of the ten _Streng Geheim_ envelopes.
    
 5. Put all _Policy_ cards in the remaining envelope.
 
### Optional

 - Fill three A5 sheet protectors:
 
    - one with the rule booklet,
    - one with the _Streng Geheim_ envelopes, and
    - one with the rest of the material.
    
   Tie them together in a pretty way.
